    "\n",
    "1. **Quoted vs. Unquoted Delimiters**: Using `'EOF'` vs `EOF` changes how variable substitution works\n",
    "2. **Inconsistent Delimiters**: Using different start and end markers (`EOL` vs `EOF`)\n",
    "3. **Indentation**: Some parsers require the closing delimiter to be at the start of a line without any indentation"

    "## Problem Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the error and the configuration snippet above, we can identify the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The heredoc syntax in the supervisord.conf file is causing parsing errors\n",
    "2. The issue appears to be with the `EOF` delimiter used in the heredoc\n",
    "3. The error occurs when supervisor tries to parse this file at startup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points about supervisor parsing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervisor uses the Python ConfigParser module which doesn't support embedded heredocs in configuration values. When we include a shell heredoc within a supervisor configuration value, it can cause parsing issues."

    "\n",
    "We have a few options to fix this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Escape the heredoc syntax properly** so the supervisor parser doesn't interpret the EOF markers\n",
    "2. **Use a separate script file** instead of embedding the script directly in the supervisor config\n",
    "3. **Modify the heredoc syntax** to use a different approach that works with supervisor\n",

    "For simplicity, let's use the first approach and fix the heredoc syntax in the supervisord.conf file."
